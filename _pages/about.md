I am a Ph.D. student in the Robotics Institute at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), supervised by Prof. [Jiaoyang Li](https://jiaoyangli.me/) and Prof. [Stephen Smith](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/stephen-smith/). My research interests include multi-robot coordination, autonomous exploration, and multi-agent motion planning.

Previously, I completed my MSc in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, co-advised by Prof. [Ji Zhang](https://frc.ri.cmu.edu/~zhangji/) and Prof. [Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/). I received my bachelor's degree in Automation from Zhejiang University.

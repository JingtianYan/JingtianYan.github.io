This project focuses on developing a comprehensive multi-agent path finding (MAPF) system specifically designed for warehouse automation environments. The system combines efficient path planning algorithms with robust execution mechanisms to handle real-world uncertainties and dynamic conditions.

## Key Features

* **Advanced MAPF Algorithms**: Implementation of state-of-the-art multi-agent path finding techniques optimized for warehouse layouts
* **Robust Execution**: Error recovery and replanning capabilities to handle unexpected obstacles and delays  
* **Real-time Performance**: Optimized for real-time execution with multiple robots operating simultaneously
* **Warehouse Integration**: Designed specifically for typical warehouse operations including picking, packing, and inventory management

## Technical Details

The system addresses several key challenges in warehouse automation:
- Collision-free path planning for multiple robots
- Dynamic obstacle avoidance
- Task scheduling and coordination
- Real-time replanning when plans become infeasible

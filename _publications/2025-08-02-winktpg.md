## Overview

This work presents WinkTPG (Windowed kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning), a novel execution framework for Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) that addresses the gap between theoretical MAPF algorithms and real-world deployment requirements. While existing MAPF algorithms rely on simplified kinodynamic models, WinkTPG enables agents to directly follow generated MAPF plans by incorporating temporal reasoning and speed optimization.

<!-- ## Key Contributions

### 1. Kinodynamic Temporal Plan Graph Planning (kTPG)
- Multi-agent speed optimization algorithm that refines MAPF plans into kinodynamically feasible plans
- Accounts for uncertainties while preserving collision-freeness
- Bridges the gap between simplified MAPF models and real-world kinodynamic constraints

### 2. Windowed Execution Framework (WinkTPG)
- Incrementally refines MAPF plans using a window-based mechanism
- Dynamically incorporates agent information during execution to reduce uncertainty
- Provides real-time adaptation capabilities for changing conditions -->
